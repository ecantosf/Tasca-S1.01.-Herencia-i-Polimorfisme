# POO Inheritance & Polymorphism Exercises 

## Description**: 
Practical exercises to master two core Object-Oriented Programming concepts: inheritance 
and polymorphism. Learn to efficiently reuse code, build class hierarchies, and leverage 
polymorphic methods for dynamic behavior.
  

## Exercise Statement
This module consists of progressive exercises to practice:. 
En aquest grup, hi ha tres tipus d’instrumen
- Designing class hierarchies with shared attributes and methods.
- Using abstract methods and method overriding (@Override) to adapt behaviors.
- Applying static and final members.
- Implementing interfaces and practicing multiple inheritance through interfaces.
- Building a system with various objects and functionalities to consolidate learning.

## Features
- Reusable code through inheritance hierarchies
- Polymorphic method calls for flexible behavior
- Abstract classes and interface implementations
- Static and final member usage
- Clean, structured Java projects with IntelliJ

## Technologies   
- Language: Java
- IDE: IntelliJ IDEA
